# Voice Router — Dataset

Case 2 dataset: a voice AI agent for the contact center of **Saqta Insurance**. The agent picks the right scenario with an LLM layer (no intent classifier) and talks like a good human operator, in Kazakh and Russian.

All data is synthetic. Saqta Insurance, its products, prices, rules, clients, addresses and clinics are fictional and simplified. They do not reflect real legislation.

**Snapshot date:** `2026-10-01`. Treat it as "today".

## Company

**Saqta Insurance** — general (non-life) insurer in Kazakhstan. Founded 2009, HQ in Almaty, 8 branches, ~600,000 clients. Serves individuals and companies in Kazakh and Russian.

| Line | Products |
|---|---|
| Auto | OGPO (mandatory motor third-party liability), CASCO (voluntary car insurance) |
| Health | DMS (voluntary health insurance): mostly corporate, also individual |
| Travel | Medical insurance for trips abroad, 24/7 medical assistance |
| Property | Apartments and houses |
| Accident | Personal accident insurance |

Not offered: life insurance, pension annuities, loans. Such requests are `SYS_OUT_OF_SCOPE`.

Contact center: sales Mon–Sat 08:00–20:00, claims and medical assistance 24/7.

**What makes insurance calls hard**
- The same words mean different scenarios: "авария" can be *accident right now* (SC11), *victim claim* (SC12) or *CASCO claim* (SC13).
- Status vs. dispute: "выплату одобрили, но мало" is a dispute (SC19), not a status request (SC17).
- Urgent cases (accident on the road, illness abroad, fraud) must be recognized and handled first.
- Clients switch topics and languages mid-sentence.
- Many actions are irreversible (issue, change, cancel a policy, file a claim) and need explicit confirmation.

### scenarios.json

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `scenario_id`, `slug`, `name` | `SC01`…`SC40` |
| `domain` | `auto`, `health`, `travel`, `property`, `accident`, `corporate`, `general` |
| `category` | `sales`, `claims`, `servicing`, `info`, `feedback`, `contact`, `security` |
| `description` | What the client wants. Main input for the LLM router |
| `not_this_if` | Boundary rules: `{condition, use_instead}`. Use them in the router prompt |
| `priority` | `normal`, `high`, `urgent`. Urgent goes first in multi-intent turns |
| `fast_path_eligible` | Simple informational scenario, can be served by a cheap fast path |
| `requires_identification` | Client must be identified (phone, IIN, policy or claim number) before actions |
| `slots.required`, `slots.optional` | Names from `slots.json`. Slots can be filled from the client profile or earlier turns |
| `actions` | Names from `actions.json` |
| `requires_confirmation` | `true` if the scenario runs an irreversible action. Read back and get an explicit "yes" first |
| `handoff` | `{when, queue}` or `null` |
| `examples` | 4 ru + 3 kk example utterances |
| `responses` | `opening` and `closing` lines in ru and kk. Style reference, not a script. `{placeholders}` come from slots or action outputs |

### slots.json

`name`, `type` (`string`, `enum`, `integer`, `date`, `boolean`, `list`, `text`), `description`, `pattern` or `values`, `prompt.ru`, `prompt.kk`.

Normalize spoken values: "восемь семьсот один…" → `+7701…`, "ертең" → date, "двадцатого года" → `2020`. Dates are resolved against the snapshot date.

### actions.json

`name`, `description`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `errors`, `irreversible`. Implement them as mocks over `mock_backend.json` and `knowledge_base.json`. `queues` lists handoff targets.

Errors use one format: `{"error": {"code": "not_found", "message": "..."}}`. Codes are listed in `error_codes`, expected agent behavior in `error_handling`. Example: unknown phone → `find_client` returns `not_found` → the agent re-asks once, then offers another identifier or an operator.

Irreversible actions: `create_policy`, `renew_policy`, `update_policy`, `cancel_policy`, `create_claim`, `create_dispute`, `book_inspection`, `book_appointment`, `update_contact`.

### knowledge_base.json

Company facts, offices, inspection points, products with pricing formulas, clinics, claim rules and document lists, payments, cancellation, bonus-malus, app help, fraud policy, complaints. The agent must answer from this file, not invent facts.

### mock_backend.json

`clients`, `policies`, `claims`, `payments`. IDs: `C001`, `SQ-OGPO-104501`, `CL-500287`, `P-3001`. Unknown IIN → bonus-malus class `3`. Prices in the backend follow the formulas in the knowledge base. New IDs created by your mocks must not collide with existing ones.

### dialogs_sample.json

Each dialog: `dialog_id`, `title`, `tags`, `client_id`, `turns`. Client turns: `text`, `lang`, `scenarios` (expected, in order), `slots` (extracted in this turn). Bot turns: `text`, `lang`, `actions` (`mode: preview` = shown for confirmation, `execute` = done).

Covers: scenario switch, topic switch and return, mixed speech, language switch, clarification, handoff, irreversible action with confirmation.

### dev_utterances.json

`id`, `text`, `lang` (`ru`, `kk`, `mixed`), `expected` (ordered list of scenario IDs), `type` (`single`, `multi_intent`, `out_of_scope`, `unclear`). 84 single, 13 multi-intent, 4 out of scope, 3 unclear; 7 mixed-language. The jury uses a different, hidden set of the same kind.

```
python evaluate.py predictions.json dev_utterances.json
```

`predictions.json`: `{"U001": ["SC01"], "U085": ["SC27", "SC04"], ...}`. Reports primary accuracy, full match and multi-intent recall, split by language and type.

**Layer 1 — Triage** (fast, per utterance)
- Language: `ru`, `kk` or `mixed`; reply in the client's dominant language, switch when the client switches.
- Normalization: numbers, phones, plates, dates.
- Urgency signals: accident now, abroad and ill, fraud.
- Split multi-intent utterances into parts.

**Layer 2 — LLM Router**
- Input: utterance (or part), dialog state, scenario catalog (`description`, `not_this_if`, a few examples).
- Output (contract):

```json
{
  "scenarios": [
    {"scenario_id": "SC30", "confidence": 0.86, "reason": "money charged, policy not issued"},
    {"scenario_id": "SC29", "confidence": 0.78, "reason": "moved, wants to change address"}
  ],
  "alternatives": [{"scenario_id": "SC26", "confidence": 0.31}],
  "language": "ru",
  "slots": {"payment_date": "2026-09-30"},
  "is_continuation": false
}
```

**Decision policy**
- `confidence ≥ 0.75` → run the scenario.
- `0.45–0.75` → `SYS_UNCLEAR`: one short question with the top-2 options.
- `< 0.45` twice in a row, or client asks → handoff with context.
- Several scenarios → `urgent` first, then in spoken order; confirm you will handle the rest.
- Continuation of the active scenario → fill slots, do not re-route.

**Scenario executor** — state machine per scenario: identify client if needed → ask missing slots one by one → call actions → read back and confirm irreversible actions → close. On topic switch, push the current scenario to a stack and offer to return after the new one is done.

**Response** — LLM generation constrained by scenario, slots, action results and the knowledge base. Never state a fact that is not in the data.

**Fast path (optional)** — `fast_path_eligible` scenarios can be served without the full LLM call. Measure the latency gain.

## Conversation rules

- 1–2 short sentences per turn. One question at a time.
- Acknowledge first, then act: "Сочувствую, давайте оформим."
- Empathy in claims and complaints, calm speed in urgent cases.
- Numbers for speech: "тридцать восемь тысяч тенге", not "38000 KZT".
- Mask personal data when reading back: `r***@mail.example`.
- Read back and get an explicit "yes" before irreversible actions.
- If asked "are you a robot?", answer honestly.
- Hand off to a human with a short context summary, so the client does not repeat themselves.

## Trace (show after each client turn)

  "turn": 3,
  "transcript": "...",
  "language": "mixed",

  "alternatives": [{"scenario_id": "SC23", "confidence": 0.4}],

}
```

## Evaluation

- The jury reads 10 hidden utterances live: simple, topic switch, boundary, mixed language, Kazakh, and requests that must not be routed to a business scenario.
- Each utterance, up to 3 points: correct primary scenario; all scenarios for multi-intent (otherwise correct reply language); answer quality against the data.
- Latency is optional and gives bonus points only; a slow solution loses nothing. Measured as end of client speech → first audio of the reply (`latency_ms.total`), median over the set: ≤ 1.5 s → +2, ≤ 3 s → +1, > 3 s → 0. The jury spot-checks with a stopwatch.
- Personas in the hidden set use clients from `mock_backend.json`. Your agent must identify them by phone number and use their data.

## Allowed tools

Any external or cloud LLM, STT and TTS APIs. Intent classifiers (encoder-based models trained to map utterances to intents) are not allowed for scenario selection.
